<h1>Hard to say I'm sorry</h1>

<p>Everybody needs a little time away</p>
<p>I heard her say</p>
<p>From each other</p>

<p>Even lovers need a holiday</p>
<p>Far away from each other</p>

<p>Hold me now</p>
<p>It's hard for me to say I'm sorry</p>
<p>I just want you to stay</p>

<p>After all that we've been through</p>
<p>I will make it up to you</p>
<p>I promise to</p>

And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for a day
From your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away
From the one that I love

Hold me now
It is hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to

After all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
